# Custom ML Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Custom ML Algorithms Repository! This repository contains custom implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm is implemented using Python and is designed to provide a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Provide clear, understandable implementations of machine learning algorithms.
- Serve as a learning resource for those interested in understanding algorithmic details.
- Demonstrate the core principles and mathematics behind each algorithm.

## Algorithms Implemented

Currently, the repository includes implementations of the following algorithms:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

Each algorithm is implemented in its own directory, with detailed comments explaining the key steps and calculations involved.
